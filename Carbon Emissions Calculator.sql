Core assumptions:
1. All thigs being equal except for CPU usage
2. Memory power consumption remains statatic
3. Storage power consumption remains static
4. Hyperthreading enabled
5. Base CPU consumption remains static
	Refer to https://www.kompulsa.com/much-power-computers-consume/,
	Base Watt Usage of CPU = =IF([@Basefreq]<2.2,75,IF([@Basefreq]<3.2,60,50))
6. CPU power usage per vCPU calculated as follows
	Refer to https://www.kompulsa.com/much-power-computers-consume/, then
	Per vCPU Usage Watt =[@Cores]*2*IF([@Basefreq]<2.2,1.5,IF([@Basefreq]<3.2,2.5,ROUND([@Basefreq],0)))
7. Conversion rate of 1 kWh = 0.5kg (This can vary per country). 1W = 0.5g of CO2

When a single core is active, it consumes ~13.5 watts. This slowly goes down when more cores get loaded, 
but at 6 cores loaded we are still consuming ~12 watts per core. 
Even at 16 cores loaded, we’re still around 10 watts per core. This is pretty impressive. 
At full core loading, we’re fluctuating between 6 and 11 watts per core, 
as workloads get moved around to manage core loading.

Offset SQL only. Calculate CPU cycles used since startup
Calculate cycles for last 5 hours
compare to SQL ring buffer usage.
Calculate CPU speed mulitply by number of cores and utilization

Indexes:
Now to convert 1 Cost to 1 Watt.
Easier to convert cost of query to overall SQL CPU usage
As soon as we have the cost of the query as %, we can correlate with SQL CPU usage accross n CPU cores.
